README: Credit Card Customer Retention Hypothesis
The reason I selected this topic is that I once worked for the credit card collections section of HSBC. This experience provides valuable insight into the challenges and opportunities in customer retention for credit card services.
This project aims to develop a hypothesis for the desirable situation for the bank manager to retain credit card customers. Our approach leverages data analysis and customer incentives to reduce churn rates and improve overall customer satisfaction.
Hypothesis
We hypothesise that by offering targeted incentives and analysing customer data, we can significantly reduce credit card customer churn. Our strategy focuses on two key areas:
1. Existing Customer Retention: Offering interest-free periods to current credit card holders based on their usage patterns and risk profiles.
2. New Customer Acquisition: Providing a 6-month interest-free period for new credit card customers to encourage sign-ups and establish long-term relationships.
Project Objectives
1. Develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to process and analyse customer data.
2. Create data visualizations to identify patterns and trends in customer behaviour.
3. Build predictive models to assess churn probability for individual customers.
4. Design targeted retention strategies based on analytical insights.
Data Analysis Goals
1. Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
2. Segment customers based on their likelihood to churn.
3. Develop actionable insights for personalised retention strategies.
Methodology
1. Data Extraction: Utilise the Kaggle dataset on credit card customers as our primary data source.
2. Data Transformation: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables for analysis.
3. Data Loading: Store the transformed data in a suitable format for further analysis.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to understand customer behaviour patterns.
5. Predictive Modelling: Develop models to estimate churn probability for individual customers.
6. Visualization: Create informative visualizations to communicate insights effectively.

By implementing this approach, we aim to provide the bank managewith the tools and insights necessary to proactively address customer churn and improve overall retention rates in their credit card services.
